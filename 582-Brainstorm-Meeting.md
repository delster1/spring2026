# 582 Brainstorm Meeting 

## Idea 1 - RPI Network Monitor

RPI network monitor
- web app 
    - alerts for weird behavior
    - status of devices
    - configuration
    - ai tool
- multi-device monitoring 
    - maybe basic OS security
    - maybe some location-based monitoring
    - avtivity and maybe usage info
- possible ai integration 
    - maybe ai to recommend solutions or suggestions on weird behavior
- plug-and-play solution for small businesses

implementation:
- network
    - maybe use cloud network if necessary
    - could work w/ bardas on KU network setup
    - could use home wifi (risky)
- rpi 
    - basic network security - firewall, ids, etc.
    - device monitoring / status checking 
    - stores device info
- devices  
    - run client!

## Idea 2 - Better To-Do

To-do with more motivation / different structure
- keep user accountable!
- incentive to managing day-to-day

**What can we do?**
finch
- complete tasks to feed finch
- get strong finch
- *no custom tasks*

other apps
- no incentive 

ads for $$$! (lol)

incentives:
- back tracker - show progress
- gives compliment / accomplishment after tasks 
- raspberry pi integration!
- freezing / starving / near-dead animals
- social media system
    - post about people 
    - links with person
    - publicize pets 
- stop cheating - don't make ppl feel bad for missing tasks

implementation:
- react-native
- lcd screen for pet
    - different animations for sadness, hunger, etc.
- due dates
- complicated tasks:
    - due dates
    - eisenhower matrix
    - goals
    - adding work days 
- weights:
    - time-period based points
    - penalties for not completing by due date?

### Jack's Note

Do one small thing one-by-one 
- make it incremental
- allow people to build on success

Make it social
- how healthy is my pet?
- how secure is my network?

## Idea 3 - Better Notes app 

Use tagging systems, LLMs, etc. to create a better way to take notes + study
- read notes and help study
- help students take notes 

## Idea 4 - LaundrySense
Retrofitted laundry Monitor!
- monitor and alert when laundry is done 
- non-invasive visibility 
- use ML for audio/video processing 
- network-based monitor w/ privacy 

architecture
- raspberry pi w/ wifi connectivity
- audio capture & ML inference 
- adhesive connection to washing / drying machine 
- database connection for logs / any necessary data storage

implementation
- audio-based ML based on cycle status
- idle, fill, wash, rinse, ,spin, etc.
- can opt-in for per-machine fine-tuning 

## Plans for this semester

Figure out architecture first!
- big arch. doc
- meet on architecture before work starts
    - file structures
    - team strengths / focuses

Communicate More!
- PRs!
- Manage Teams
