 ### Summary of presentation (150-500 words)
 Alexander Eskilson spoke about his experience as a software engineer and details successes / failures throughout his career and how certain experiences contributed to his personal successes. He spoke about how to guide a career and be successful in a career. When asked how to specialize successfully in a career, he spoke about finding what you are passionate about / what makes you work best and the differences between certain engineers who might prefer more deep CS-level work, while others sometimes prefer interdisciplinary work and let what you appreciate guide your decision making. ANother qustion was asked about differences between startups and traditional businesses. Alex said the main difference between startups and traditional busiensses were the work amount and diversity. At larger companies, your day-to-day is more defined while at startups your work can change very quickly as business values change. Another question was asked about deciding when to move outside of a company. Alexander spoke about letting your passion guide your decisions. If you get into a large company and aren't doing something you enjoy, talk to those teams and try to get involved. Some companies are more open to lateral movement, while some arent. If you realize you cannot achieve what you'd like to at a company and the company isn't supporting your own goals, then it makes sense to move. He also spoke about how companies view engineers as "fungible," and to remember than when maintaining loyalty to a corporation or job. When asked about AI applications and maintaining safety, he spoke about the importance of ethical usage of AI while describing the failurs of the AI safety industry.  

### What did you learn from the presentation (50-150 words)?

The industry's opinion on AI is not as cut-and-dry as it seems. It seems like many engineers are more opposed to the implementation of, and widespread use of AI than I initially supposed. The AI industry has immense impacts on how we live in our day-to-day lives, geopolitics, and how our government runs. There's more fear than I initially expected surrounding these concerns.

### What will you do different because of this presentation (75-250 words)?

Be more vigilant of negative applications of AI in my industry and vocal about decisions that go against my personal morals, and to be willing to leave a cororation if necessary. One thing Alex mentioned in a conversation I had with him after lecture was: engineers at United Healthcare implemented models that take advantage of user's data to deny claims and charge exorbitant rates. I will be more vigilant of the ways any corporations I work at apply AI and willing to be vocal about any ethical violations.
