## Guest Speaker 1 

Report Format:
### Date of Presentation
    - 2/2/2026
### Time of Presentation
    - 12:00 
### Name of Presentation
    - Guest Speaker - Alexander Eskilson
### Name of Presenter(s)
    - Alexander Eskilson

 ### Summary of presentation (150-500 words)
 Alexander Eskilson spoke about his experience as a software engineer and details successes / failures throughout his career and how certain experiences contributed to his personal successes. He spoke about how to guide a career and be successful in a career. When asked how to specialize successfully in a career, he spoke about finding what you are passionate about / what makes you work best and the differences between certain engineers who might prefer more deep CS-level work, while others sometimes prefer interdisciplinary work and let what you appreciate guide your decision making. ANother qustion was asked about differences between startups and traditional businesses. Alex said the main difference between startups and traditional busiensses were the work amount and diversity. At larger companies, your day-to-day is more defined while at startups your work can change very quickly as business values change. Another question was asked about deciding when to move outside of a company. Alexander spoke about letting your passion guide your decisions. If you get into a large company and aren't doing something you enjoy, talk to those teams and try to get involved. Some companies are more open to lateral movement, while some arent. If you realize you cannot achieve what you'd like to at a company and the company isn't supporting your own goals, then it makes sense to move. He also spoke about how companies view engineers as "fungible," and to remember than when maintaining loyalty to a corporation or job. When asked about AI applications and maintaining safety, he spoke about the importance of ethical usage of AI while describing the failurs of the AI safety industry.  

### What did you learn from the presentation (50-150 words)?

The industry's opinion on AI is not as cut-and-dry as it seems. It seems like many engineers are more opposed to the implementation of, and widespread use of AI than I initially supposed. The AI industry has immense impacts on how we live in our day-to-day lives, geopolitics, and how our government runs. There's more fear than I initially expected surrounding these concerns.

### What will you do different because of this presentation (75-250 words)?

Be more vigilant of negative applications of AI in my industry and vocal about decisions that go against my personal morals, and to be willing to leave a cororation if necessary. One thing Alex mentioned in a conversation I had with him after lecture was: engineers at United Healthcare implemented models that take advantage of user's data to deny claims and charge exorbitant rates. I will be more vigilant of the ways any corporations I work at apply AI and willing to be vocal about any ethical violations.

## Guest Speaker 2 

### Date of Presentation
    - 2/4/2026
### Time of Presentation
    - 12:00 
### Name of Presentation
    - Guest Speaker - Sharmil Desai
### Name of Presenter(s)
    - Sharmil Desai

 ### Summary of presentation (150-500 words)
 Sharmil Desai spoke about his early career and time as the CEO of menufy. He had a typical software engineering career, starting at a smaller company and moving to larger ones as time went on. One thing he noted specifically was how an engineering framework of thinking lends itself to business. Throughout his career, he had to overcome some interesting engineering challenges. For example, menufy had scaling problems due to a reliance on fax machines for order processing. This led to the creation of an ipad / tablet based solution. This reduced the latency required to process orders, and improved the menufy system. Some other issues Sharmil mentions running into were with support tickets. He mentioned that an engineer's job is to solve problems, not just to write code. One way he says this can be done is through data. By tracking menu design, support, response times, etc. we can easily see and understand problems, making them easier to solve. He also talks about unexpected problems that arose and their solutions, specifically, the pandemic caused resources to be overwhelmed in certain instances, requiring smart engineering stragegies like caching, queuing, and automations to solve those issues. 

### What did you learn from the presentation (50-150 words)?

One thing Sharmil mentioneed repeatedly was the importance of having data in problem solving. If we don't have any data, then we cannot make conclusions and understand the sources of problems. I had previously underestimated the importane of data in problem solving. By collecting data associated with a project or program, we can very easily understand and identify unexpected behaviors.

### What will you do different because of this presentation (75-250 words)?

In programs or projects that I work on, I'll focus more on logging, visualizing, and collecting data. As projects increase in size, having an accessible method of viewing data becomes instrumental. In Sharmil's presentation when speaking about errors or problems with Menufy, he always had a graph or some sort of visualization that he could point to, which displayed the error and provided much needed context.
