# Spring 26 Projects
List of projects (coding)

## Homelab!

### Ideas:
- YAML for configs 
    - maybe a config repo?
    - All open ports & why 
    - basic IDS
    - SSH usage logging 
- DB for logins 
    - central auth service - maybe even do cookies?
    - admin vs. user views - configure plex server
    - To-do list / tasks db 
- Central Service inventory - knows what's running, where, etc.
    - /health endpoint for each server!
        - maybe runs through rpi or smth
    - heartbeat system - machines report uptimes and stuff
    - YAML to describe what should be active, server flags when this ain't true
    - expose systemd status across-machines
    - Log aggregator
    - Inbound Connections Log - ASN 
    - API contract validation
- Network Usage visualizer / tracker 
    - Basic CI/CD for services?
    - auto-update OS 
- Site
    - live status page public
    - live dashboard private 
    - what's running page
- ML stuff  
    - monitor network / cpu usage for upticks
    - log clustering
    - ML to supress repetitive logs
