### Date of Presentation
    - 2/16/2026
### Time of Presentation
    - 12:00 
### Name of Presentation
    - Software-defined Accelerated Networking @ Microsoft
### Name of Presenter(s)
    - James Hurd

 ### Summary of presentation (150-500 words)
 James talked about his experience at microsoft and his current work. He is currently working on Software-Defined Accelerated Network on the Azure team. He spoke about the specific of software-defined accelerated networking, specifically about the networking technology required and the details of Microsoft's implementation. One thing he mentioned was the Virtual Filtering Platform, a piece of technology that is used to add and control headers on a network request. By using a Virtual Filtering Platform, when we have packets that follow certain rules, we can allow those packets to "skip" any software processing required, using hardware to speed up the packet processing process. James' team is responsible for designing and running tests on hardware to ensure that specific products match the Service Level Agreements as defined by the vendors. Network Performance testing is incredibly hard because the longer a team has to test, the shorter a vendor can use a product. Especially when errors come up, and changes are required to the tested products.

### What did you learn from the presentation (50-150 words)?

I learned more about the complexities of implementing and using cloud-based networks. Specifically, I found the usage of FPGAs to speed-up data processing extremely interesting. By reprogamming FPGAs with certain rules, James' team can allow certain packets to bypass any software processing, which immensely speeds up data proecessing speed, which is vital for the cloud. 

### What will you do different because of this presentation (75-250 words)?

I will keep VFPs in mind as a tool to use for any network administration that must take place. Their applicability to different networking technologies - firewalls, priority filters, etc. - is incredible. I hope to set-up a VFP on my homelab system and see how I can use it to enable priority destinations, deny traffic, and more.
