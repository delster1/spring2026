## Intro to eecs 695 

### Binary analysis

**what and why** 
*what's binary analysis?*
- techniques that determine properties of binary software or object  
- can be done statically or dynamically

*why binary analysis?* 
-  source code not available
    - malware
- binary generated by compiler may be semantically different than corresponding source code 
- some apps may be in multiple languages or have inlined assembly, single source-level analysis might not be adequate
- needed before applying binary-level optimizations or before binary instrumentation
    - ex - retrofitting security into binaries


### static & dynamic binary analysis
**static** 
- doesnt run the binary
    - doesn't need to know program inputs (+)
    - can analayze entire program (even parts not at runtime) (+)
    - can analyze program parts not reached at runtime (+)
    - can analyze programs of different architectures (+)

    - challenging, no knowledge of program runtime state (-)
    - may not be able ot reach all code, might read data as code (-)

**dynamic** 
- runs the binary and analyzes traces
    - simpler, knows the exact instruction trace + program state (+)
    - may not reach all program instructions during executions

### binary software RE?
**what is?** 
- RE is an application of binary analysis
- RE:
    - analyzes binary software to obtain implementation info
    - recover software requirements for design
    - recover implementation information

**when to conduct:** 
- obtain missing info, ideas, system design
- main categories:
    - security related
    - software dev related
